# Comparison of social media archiving tools

Several social media harvesting tools exist,
we performed a comparison based on selected features to decide which tool we will reuse in our workflow.

We adapt a general web archiving framework of the [Data Together Initiative](https://github.com/datatogether/research/tree/master/web_archiving)
and add social media archiving specific columns.
A summary is available in [this GoogleSpreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGuTC9Ww5yWZQ0wSUPPnIITMJBf1JyEaDOCO0Ve-O9U/edit#gid=0) under a CC BY 4.0 license.

After an initial selection we tested several of the surveyed tools.
This folder contains the documentation
we created during this testing activity.

We thank *Stephanie Chen* for setting up and testing most of the different tools.
