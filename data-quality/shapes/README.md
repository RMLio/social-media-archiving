# Shapes

This folder contains W3C SHACL Shapes representing constraints which are used to validate the data.
Files prefixed with `astrea` were created based on ontologies using the [Astrea web service](https://astrea.linkeddata.es/).

Files in the `europeana-shapes` folder are valid W3C SHACL shapes (verified by SHACL-SHACL) adapted from existing non valid W3C SHACL shapes from https://github.com/hugomanguinhas/europeana_shapes .
